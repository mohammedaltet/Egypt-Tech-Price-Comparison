**Live Demo:**
🔗 [Try the app here](https://egypt-tech-price-comparison-ggzk87xsjohvskmx7hukb8.streamlit.app/)

## 🧠 What is this?

This is a personal project I built to solve a real frustration:
**Comparing prices for tech components across Egyptian online stores is a pain.**

So I built a solution:
A **Streamlit app** that aggregates and compares **real-time prices** from over **19 Egyptian e-commerce sites**.

## 🔍 Features

* 🔎 Search for any tech product (e.g., `RTX 4070`, `32GB DDR4`, `iPhone 15`)
* 🚀 Fast, **parallel scraping** across 19+ sites using `aiohttp` + `ThreadPoolExecutor`
* 📦 Filters by **price**, **store**, and **availability status**
* 📊 Live price analysis: lowest, highest, average, standard deviation
* 🧠 Smart filtering: only shows products that contain **all words** in your search
* 🧠 Suggests **alternative search terms** (e.g., `RTX` → `GeForce RTX`)
* ⚙️ Handles **European-style prices** and messy HTML
* 💾 Caching built-in (per-session and global TTL cache)
* 🧹 Optional fallback to threaded scraping if async context fails

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Streamlit**
* **aiohttp** / **BeautifulSoup**
* **pandas**
* **cachetools**
* **concurrent.futures**
* **Regular Expressions**

## 🛠️ Why I Built This

As someone who frequently buys PC components, I got tired of opening 10+ tabs just to check prices.
There was no reliable local comparison tool — so I made one for myself, and now for everyone.
